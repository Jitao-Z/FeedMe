# FeedMe
An application that helps everyone find their restaurants of belonging!

## Proposal
#### What will this application do?
This application is called *FeedMe* and has some features similar to *Yelp*. So when we select a location from the 
app, it will pop out **five** recommended restaurants for us to consider. We will be able to see a brief introduction 
for each restaurant (e.g. what type of food, the average cost per customer) and also some popular dishes in it.

#### Who will use it?
- People who want to try some new restaurants to eat in a place
- Visitors who just come to a new place and have no idea where to eat
- Tourists who want to get a taste of some delicious local cuisines

#### Why am I interested in this project?
I am a huge foodie and also a fan of a food program called _MasterChef_. Therefore, I want to design an application 
for foodies like me to target some fantastic restaurants better.
